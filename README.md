##Dootrix application

This project aims to sort one main problem 

In this report I find out how the application I created helps students to deal with their emotion. The responses that were obtained had some harsh criticism about some of the features and how some students have said how they do not think a diary will work. On a positive note the chat system was a good feature so if it were to be developed further then developing the diary side more would be a priority. It was also good to find out that making an application to help people with their emotions had a positive response. Some people thought it was a good idea that this problem was seen to. Also, even though the negative responses outweigh the positive it shows that everyone has a personal preference which hopefully in the future can be adjusted with a personalisation section for when they login. Some responses also showed how people can relate to the amount of stress and pressure mental health can give in heavy scenarios. Also admittedly there are a lot of flaws with the site that need to be changed and going through the method process again would be another priority.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
